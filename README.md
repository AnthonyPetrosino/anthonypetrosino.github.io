# [Portfolio Website](anthonypetrosino.github.io)

This site showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a computer science student and software developer. It is hosted on GitHub Pages and helps display my professional and academic journey. I'm keeping it simple to comply with the GitHub Pages requirements as well as to make hosting it locally easy.
